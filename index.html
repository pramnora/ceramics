   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <p class="clsPara">
    Hi, my name is, Paul Ramnora. I'm currently studying at WMCollege, Mornington Crescent branch.
   </p>
   <p class="clsPara">    
    Course(12 x weeks): Ceramics - Level I, with teacher: Tana West.
   </p>
   <p class="clsPara">
    I have tried doing introductory Ceramics before...
   </P> 
   <ul>
    <li>
     Lambeth College: Adare Centre
    </li>
    <li>Morley College(arts based)
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p class="clsPara"> 
  ...; but, then, the emphasis was purely on 'creating'/and, involved no note taking/homework.
   </p>

   <hr>

   <p class="clsPara">
    This is my first introduction to learning how to do Ceramics, seriously; meaning, I have to...
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Create work
    </li>
    <li>
     Take careful notes/photos about each creation step
    </li>
    <li>
     Keep a sketchbook...; and, use it to plan work. 
    </li>
    <li>
     Complete doing homework <i>tests</i> online
    </li>
    <li>
     Also, show studio health and safety
    </li>
   </ul>

   <hr>

   <p class="clsPara">
    As somebody who suffers from ADD/Attention Deficit Disorder...; therefore, my mind tends to wonder off, constantly, going all over the place...; and, thus, I find it really difficult indeed to maintain any 'strict' focus. 
   </p>
   <p class="clsPara">
    I really do <i>enjoy</i> being on the course. I attend/participate in each lesson. I also watch others to learn how they do things, too(use the potters wheel/-etc.). I take some notes...; plus, regularly, do 'ceramics related' online research both during lunch breaks/as well as, after class/-etc. 
   </p>
   <p class="clsPara">    
    However, ADD/Attention Deficit Disorder...will often lead to such things as forgetfulness/and, poor organisation... 
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     In the absolute <i>rush</i> to both get ready, and, leave home...in order to arrive at class on time...I totally forgot to bring my iPad/iPhone along with me...; so, I couldn't record nothing...?
    </li>
    <li>
     My note taking hasn't been as properly extensive as it should be...so,if there were 6 steps to be recorded; maybe, I only recorded 3...?! 
    </li>
    <li>
     As to getting homework in on time...; well, frankly, I didn't!
    </li>
    <li>
     I did buy some sculpting tools to use from off eBay...; but, then, again, I didn't always remember to bring those tools in...???
    </li>
    <li>
     Instead, of doing the homework, properly, the teachers way...such as show a Powerpoint presentation; instead, I went and did it my 'own' way, instead,
 by creating a series of web pages. (I felt within these web pages I could 'say/show/share' far more.)
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p class="clsPara">    
    Nevertheless, even if I don't pass the course exams...; being on this course, I've managed to learn far more about Ceramic creation processes than ever I knew before; and, for this I will always remain, well and truly, grateful. 
   </p>

   <p class="clsPara">    
    In conclusion, my interest in learning more about the rich art of ceramics creation..had begun long before this course ever started...at around age 16/and, now, I'm aged 60. I always loved to see: Greek/Roman/Chinese pottery...as well as, modern day pottery...; in particular, the works of Pablo Picasso. -(I used to be a regular plate collector on the Bradford exchange...collecting plates by Norman Rockwell/-etc. I also like to collect ceramic sculptures from 2nd hand shops.)- So, once this course has ended, I'm sure, my interest in both creating and learning more about Ceramic creation processes will still be ongoing...because, if anything...then, being a part of the course has increased my enthusiasm for studying learning how to do ceramics all the more/as opposed to having in any way at all dampened it. 
   </p>  
   <p class="clsPara">    
    If there is any one lesson I learned in particular it's that creating ceramic 'masterpieces' is nowhere near as easy as it looks...?! (I used to visit Harrords Knightsbridge store/and, also, visit Bond Street shops where I admired the works of Lallique/Wedgewood/-etc.)? I wanted to create a masterpiece head/or, dancer...? But, all the time, I was very deeply 'aware' that I lacked the necessary 'fine art' related skills. Namely, in order to be successful at producing ''human forms'; then, you have to know 'anatomy' really well. In order to create a hand with fingers...; it takes much effort/persevation/concentration/knowledge/patience...; I didn't really have those skills.../or, maybe, I just needed more time to be able to develop it...? The thing about studying art -(or, maybe, any other subject which you are truly <strong>passionate</strong> about)- is...you must never ever quit...; then, who knows, maybe, one day...either sooner or later...you will achieve what are your own end goals...???
