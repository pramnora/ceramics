## Introduction

At age 60 I decided to return back to going to college, again, once more.  

-(The reason why I choose WMCollege...was the prices were 50% off for those people who are *unemployed*.)-  

I had been a college drop out many times before...; so, it was with some feeling of trepidation that I worried about re-joining college.  



In particular, I worried would I be able to...  

- wake up on time...? (After getting used to going to bed really late in the early morning.)  

- arrive there on time...? This college is located over 1 hour travel away. I have to take bus, first(West Norwood bus garage to Brixton tube station: 2/196/322); then, switch to taking tube(Brixton to Warren Street); then, switch again to a different tube platform(Warren Street to Mornington Crescent).   

- keep up with doing the home work? I have ADD/Attention Deficit Disorder...; and, I tend to put off doing tedious tasks I dislike right up until when the very last minute comes...; then, it either gets done/;or else, not at all...?!  

- get along well with all of the other students? Sometimes, I do.../other times not. (I've even dropped out in the past...if I found I couldn't get along well with other students/or, the teacher themselves.)  



In the actual event, all of my fears were really quite right.   

- I tried my best to minimise socialising with others...; in that way, we are likely to have less fallings out.  
- I sometimes still stay up really late watching TV/Internet...until when morning comes; then, find I can't wake up in time.  
- I didn't complete doing the homework...which I found either too difficult/or, too boring/or, just didn't have effective enough time management skills to organise and get the work done on time.  
- travelling was hard. Such as long journey...I would say, at least, 90% of the time I was 'late'. Sometimes, so late...I didn't even bother going.
