## Introduction

At age 60 I decided to return back to going to college, once more.

I had been a college drop out many times before...; so, it was with some feeling of trepidation that I worried about re-joining college...would I be able to keep up with the time table schedule...; and, especially, as this college is located over 1 hour travel away. I have to take bus, first(2/196/322); then, switch to taking tube train(Brixton to Warren Street); then, switch again to a different tube train platform(Warren Street to Mornington Crescent).
