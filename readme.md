## Introduction

At age 60 I decided to return back to going to college, again, once more.

I had been a college drop out many times before...; so, it was with some feeling of trepidation that I worried about re-joining college.

In particular, I worried would I be able to...

- wake up on time...? (After getting used to going to bed really late in the early morning.)

- arrive there on time...? This college is located over 1 hour travel away. I have to take bus, first(West Norwood bus garage to Brixton tube station: 2/196/322); then, switch to taking tube(Brixton to Warren Street); then, switch again to a different tube platform(Warren Street to Mornington Crescent). 

- keep up with doing the home work? I have ADD/Attention Deficit Disorder...; and, I tend to put off doing tedious tasks I dislike right up until when the very last minute comes.../then, it either gets done/or, not at all...?!
